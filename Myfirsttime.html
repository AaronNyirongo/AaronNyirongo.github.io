	<h1>Known as the Weeping Prophet,</h1> <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">Chiwempal Church of the Nazarene.com</a>Jeremiah was a prophet to the southern kingdom of Judah in the Old Testament, right before Judah ultimately fell to Babylon and was led away into captivity. God sent Jeremiah to a crumbling nation to warn of their impending demise – a warning they didn’t heed.</p>
